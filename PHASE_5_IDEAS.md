# Phase 5 Enhancement Ideas

## ðŸŽ¯ Loading State Improvements

### Aceternity Loader with Agent Status
**Reference**: https://ui.aceternity.com/components/loader

**Concept**: Replace simple bouncing dots with an overlay showing real-time agent progress

**Features**:
- Faded/transparent overlay covering the entire screen when processing
- Animated loader component (Aceternity style)
- Real-time status updates showing which agent is currently running:
  - "Extracting transcript..."
  - "Generating lecture notes..."
  - "Identifying AI tools..."
  - "Saving to database..."
- Progress indicator (e.g., "2/4 agents complete")
- Smooth transitions between states

**Technical Approach**:
- WebSocket connection from frontend to backend
- Backend sends progress events as agents complete
- Frontend displays current agent status in overlay
- Prevents user interaction while processing
- Dismisses automatically when complete

**Benefits**:
- Better user experience (knows what's happening)
- Professional look and feel
- Builds confidence in the multi-agent system
- Makes processing time feel shorter

**Priority**: Medium (Phase 5 feature)
